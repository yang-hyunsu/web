		<p>Such a feeling's coming over me.<br/>
		There is wonder in most every thing I see.<br/>
		Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes.<br/>
		And I won't be surprised if it's a dream.</p>
		<p>Everything I want the world to be is 
		now coming true especially for me.<br/>
		And the reason is clear. <br/>
		It's because you are here.<br/>
		You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen.</p>
		<p>I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation.<br/>
		And the only explanation I can find is the love, <br/>
		that I've found ever since you've been around.<br/>
		Your love's put me at the top of the world.</p>
		
		<p>Something in the wind has learned my name.<br/>
		And it's telling me that things are not the same.<br/>
		In the leaves, on the trees and the touch of the breeze.<br/>
		There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me.</p>
		<p>There is only one wish on my mind.<br/>
		When this day is through, I hope that I will find,<br/>
		that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me.<br/>
		All I need will be mine if you are here.</p>
